            <h3>I am struggling to find a method in python which allows you to read data in a currently used web
                browser. Effectively, I am trying to download a massive dataframe of data on a locally controlled
                company webpage and implement it into a dataframe. The issue is that the website has a fairly
                complex authentication token process which I have not been able to bypass using Selenium using a
                slew of webdrivers, Requests, urllib, and cookielib using a variety of user parameters. I have given
                up on this front entirely as I am almost positive that there is more to the authentication process
                than can be achieved easily with these libraries.</h3>
